## Welcome to `Rigcoin`
## THE MAINNET CONTRACT HAS A CRITICAL BUG. DO NOT MINT ON IT.

These contracts are RETIRED. The project remains active while working on community logistics and rethinking some aspects. Please reach out if you have any questions, suggestions or would like to contribute in a meaningful way.

The next step for this project is to develop a community of 500 - 1000 OG's who are excited to Mint Rigcoins before releasing a STABLE and AUDITED updated.

##PLEASE DO NOT MINT USING THE BROKEN MAINNET CONTRACT BELOW.

A collection of 5,000 NFTs that mine Rigcoin.

### Image Proofs
There are 3 image sizes for each NFT, but only the 600x600 size is what
will show up inside Metamask and other platforms by default. Each NFT conforms to the
"ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema" [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), and each has
additional metadata outlined below - some of which is not currently supported, but
has been included for the future.
